# Adjust Selection
Adjust the edge and opacity of global mask (selection).

---

If you want to adjust the edge of the global selection, you can use the following sliders:
* Grow: Expand the edge of global mask (selection).
* Contract: Shrink the edge of global mask.
* Feather Edge: Smooth and feather the edge of global mask.
* Opacity: Adjust the opacity of the mask. This will take effect on the filters that you apply to the image later.

<font color=#40874A>You can fill small holes by applying grow and contract at the same time (morphological closing).</font>
