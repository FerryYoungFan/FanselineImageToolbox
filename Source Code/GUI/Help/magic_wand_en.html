Click on the image, it will select the surroundings according to the tolerance you set.<br/>
There are two tolerance sliders in RGB Channel:<br/>
* Upper Difference: Determine how "bright" a color can be considered as selection.<br/>
* Lower Differnece: Determine how "dark" a color can be considered as selection.<br/>

<h3>Step 2</h3>
If you want to adjust the edge of the current selection, you can use the following sliders:<br/>
* Grow: Expand the edge of current mask (selection).<br/>
* Contract: Shrink the edge of current mask.<br/><br/>
* Feather Edge: Smooth and feather the edge of current mask.<br/><br/>
<font color=#40874A>You can fill small holes by applying grow and contract at the same time (morphological closing).</font>
