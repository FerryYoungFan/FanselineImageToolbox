<h1>Color Range</h1>
Select all pixels within the HSV color range.<br/>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
If you want to select skin by using color range method, I highly recommend you to use the auto select method on the right column at first:<br/>
* Otsu-Cr: Otsu-Nobuyuki's method for Cr-channel skin color detection.<br/>
* HSV Auto: Select skin according to the built-in HSV color range.<br/>
* YCrCb Auto: Select skin according to the built-in YCrCb color range.<br/>
<hr>
<h3>Step 2</h3>
Well, if you want to select color manually, just click on the image to pick the color that you want to select.<br/>
Then use the following sliders:<br/>
* H Tolerance: Set the select tolerance in H Channel.<br/>
* S Tolerance: Set the select tolerance in S Channel.<br/>
* V Tolerance: Set the select tolerance in V Channel.<br/>
* Soft Select: Color that out of the range will also be considered, but with less mask (selection) opacity.<br/>
<hr>
<h3>Step 3</h3>
If you want to adjust the edge of the current selection, you can use the following sliders:<br/>
* Grow: Expand the edge of current mask (selection).<br/>
* Contract: Shrink the edge of current mask.<br/><br/>
* Feather Edge: Smooth and feather the edge of current mask.<br/><br/>
<font color=#40874A>You can fill small holes by applying grow and contract at the same time (morphological closing).</font>
